# AloftMods
A grouping of random mods to demonstrate how to do things

## Setting up for development

- Copy in the DLLs from [BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) to the Assets folder
- Copy in the DLLs from the [Aloft Mod Framework](https://github.com/Sessional/AloftModLoader)
- Ensure Aloft is imported via Thunderkit

## Mods in here and what they do:
- **BeeBoxes**: A mod that adds a buildable beehive to produce wax and honey. Relies on the Aloft Mod Framework to work (content and code).
- **NoPoop**: A mod that disables droppings of manure (caveat: possibly more things) from farm animals. Code-only plugin, does not rely on the Aloft Mod Framework.
