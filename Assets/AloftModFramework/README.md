# Aloft Mod Framework

The Aloft Mod Framework is intended to be a light library that dependencies can build on top of. It is reasonable and feasible to add new content to Aloft without writing any code. As such, this framework is really intended for adding `ScriptableObjects` to Unity where one can add new content without really ever having to learn how to code.

Aloft Mod Framework relies heavily on serialization and as such will not function in any fashion work the FixSerializeTypes mod is installed.
